# IF STATEMENT
- The C++ if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not executed based on a certain type of condition.
- **Syntax**
- if(condition)
- {
- // Statements to execute if
- // condition is true
- }

# IF_ELSE STATEMENT
- he if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it wonâ€™t. But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the C++ else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.
- **Syntax**
- if (condition)
- {
- // Executes this block if
- // condition is true
- }
- else
- {
- // Executes this block if
- // condition is false
- }

# IF-ELSE LADDER
- the if-else-if ladder helps the user decide from among multiple options. The C++ if statements are executed from the top down. As soon as one of the conditions controlling the if is true, the statement associated with that if is executed, and the rest of the C++ else-if ladder is bypassed. If none of the conditions is true, then the final statement will be executed.
- **Syntax**
- if (condition)
- statement 1;
- else if (condition)
-  statement 2;
-
-
- else
-  statement;

# NESTED IF-ELSE
- Nested if-else statements are those statements in which there is an if statement inside another if else. We use nested if-else statements when we want to implement multilayer conditions(condition inside the condition inside the condition and so on). C++ allows any number of nesting levels.
- **Basic Syntax of Nested if-else**
 - if(condition1)
 - {
 -  // Code to be executed
 -  if(condition2)
 -  {
 -   // Code to be executed
 -  }
 -  else
 -  {
 -   // Code to be executed
 -  }
 - }
 - else
 - {
 -  // code to be executed
 - }
